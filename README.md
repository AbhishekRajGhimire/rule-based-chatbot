# Rule-Based Chatbot 🌍

A Spring Boot application that implements a simple **rule-based chatbot**.  
The chatbot answers questions about countries’ **capitals, national animals, and national flowers**, while remembering the selected country during a conversation (session management).  

This project demonstrates **prompt engineering** and the use of **Amazon Q Developer** to accelerate software development.
